division doesnt really work well with just integers


Divisibility
Def: let a,b be 2 different integers
a/b iff c is an integers such that b=c*a

Properties of Divisibility
(1)  a/b and b/c implies a/c

a/b implies there is an integer d such that b=d*a
b/c implies there is an integer e such that c=e*a

c=e*(d*a)
b=(e*d)*a
c=f*a
therefore a/c

(2) a/b and b/a implies a=+- b

(3) a/b and a/c, a(b-c) and a/(b+c)


given a and b then the greatest common divisor(GCD) is the largest
  integer d that divides into a and b

17 -> {1,17}
34 -> {1,2,17,34}
17 is the greatest common divisor

Division algorithm
Let a and b be integers. Then a divided by b has quotient q and remainder r

      a/b iff a=b*q+r   0 <= r <= b

Euclidean algorithm
(1)
  a = q*b+r
  where d is some divisor of (a,b)
  where e is common divisor of (b,r)

  gcd(a,b)=gcd(b,r)


  a=18
  b=4

  4/18 = d
  4/18 = 4 r 2
  18 = 4*4+2
  |    | | |
  a    b q r

  gcd(18,4) -> 2
  gcd(4,2)  -> 2
  gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,r)


Let a,b be positive integers with a>=b

Steps:
(1) Let r0 = a and r1 = b
(2) set i=1
(3) divide ri-1 by r1 to get a quotient qi and remainder ri+1
(4) if the remainder ri+1 = 0 then ri=gcd(a,b), and we are done
(5) if ri+1 > 0 then set i=i+1 and go back to step 3

example

2024 = 748*2+528
748  = 528*1+220
528  = 220*2+88
220  =  88*2+44
88   =  44*2+0

44=220*1-88*2


Extended Euclidean algorithm

Let a,b be integers then:
      au+bv=gcd(a,b)
always has a solution in the integers u and v
