direct proof
if x is even prove that x^2 is even?
even number is defined by 2*n
odd  number is defined by 2*n + 1

generic contrapositive proof
a->b
<->
!b->!a

a->b
b\a 0 1
0   1 0
1   1 1

!b->!a
b\a 0 1
0   1 0
1   1 1

if x is odd then x^2 is odd

x = 2n+1
x^2 = 4n+1
=(2n^2+2n)+1
2n(2n+1)

contradiction proof
prove that sqrt(2) is irrational
you want to try to prove that sqrt(2) is rational

sqrt(2) = a/b
assume a and b are both integers a is even and b is odd
2 = a^2/b^2
2b^2 = a^2 thus a is even because 2b is even so a must be even
a^2 = 4b^2
b^2 = 2y^2

a=2y
a^2 is 4y^2

assume
a^2 is even, a is even
therefore
a^2 = 4y^2 for some
2b^2=4y^2, b^2=2y^2
b^2 is even, but
b^2 must be odd,
because a^2 is even, for sqrt(2) to be rational, either a^2 or b^2 must be odd
