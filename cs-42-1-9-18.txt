constructive proof
  find an example that shows your proof

  Prove there are two irrational numbers a,b such that a^b is rational
  a = sqrt(2)
  b = log2(9)
  sqrt(2)^log2(9)


non constructive proof
  proving without and example

  a = sqrt(2)
  b = sqrt(2)

  a^2 = (a^2)^a^2 dont know if rational or not, assume irrational
  set a = a^2
  a^b = ((sqrt(2))^sqrt(2))^sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)^2 = 2


Prove if x^2-6x+5 is odd then x is even
  contrapositive
    assume x is odd
    x = 2n-1
    (2n-1)^2 - 6(2n-1) + 5
    4n^2 - 8n
    2(n^2 -4n)

  Direct
    x^2-6x+5 = 2n+1
    x^2 = 2(6x-2)
    x^2 = 2(something) therefore its even

  Inverse proof(doesn't prove what we want)
    assume x^2-6x+5 is even
    x^2-6x+5 = 2n
    x^2-6x = 2n-5
    x^2 = 2n-5-6x
    x^2 = 2(n-3-3x+2)+1



Prove (aUb)NC = (aNc)U(bNc)

explain it in english and it just works

for some xE(aUb)Nc
  xec
  xea and xeb
