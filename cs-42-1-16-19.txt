Extended Euclidean algorithm

Let a,b be positive integers then:
      au+bv=gcd(a,b)
always has a solution in the integers u and v

Proof
a0=b0q1+r1
solve for r1
r1=a0-b0q1

b0=r1q2+r2
b0=(a0-b0q1)q2+r2
r2=b0-(a0-b0q)q2 == b0-a0q2+b0q1q2


r2=-a0q2+b0(q1q2+1)
      u    v

at each  step, ri gets smaller until it eventually reaches 0 at rt
and our greatest common divisor is at that point


Prime numbers

P is prime if the only divisors of D are 1 and D

P/(a*b) implies P divides by at least one of a or b

Proof
Let g=gcd(a,p), this means that g=1 or g=p

case 1
g=p implies p/q

case 2
g=1 implies 1=au+pv
multiplay by b
b=abu+pbv
b=xpu+pbv
b=p(xu+bv)

therefore p divides b


claim
If p/a1a2...an, then p divides some a

Proof
knowing p/ab the np divides by either a or b

we can separates a1a2...an with parenthesis
p/a1(a2a3...an)
if p does not divide by a1 then pull out the next a
p/a2(a1a3....an)


fundamental theoren of arthimetic
Let a>=2 be an integer. then, a can be factors as a unique product of prime numbers

    a=p1^e1*p2^e2....*pr^er


two things to prove
(i)existence
(ii)uniqueness

Proof

step 1 existence
let n=2, so it exists because 2 is Prime

let n >= 2
If n is prime then n is Prime
otherwise, n is a composite number
n=a*b,where 1<a,b<n

step 2 uniqueness
a=p1^e1*p2^e2...ps^es = q1^e1*q2^e2...qt^et where pi and qs are all primes, not necessarily distinct and s!=t necessarily

p1/a implies p1/q1^a1*q2^a2...q2^a2 implies p1  divides by at least one of qi

rearranging if necessary p1/q1 implies p1=q1

so p1 and q1 cancel out from the a= equations above
and we repeat
we eventually get to 1=(qt+qs)*(qt+qs+1)
we know s=t
1=1
